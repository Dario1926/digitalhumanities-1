## Short Biography
I am a PhD student in German and part of .txtLAB at the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at McGill University. I hold an MA in Middle Eastern Studies from Leiden University and a BA in Oriental Studies from the University of Vienna. My research focuses on the question of how computational text analysis methods and tools can form a repository for cross-cultural comparative literary analysis. My research interests focus on literary geography, prestige and canonicity in literary education, reading, translational literature.

## My Research Project
In my dissertation I want to explore common and culturally specific spatial concepts in German, English and Turkish literature. By applying computational methods such as text mining, I hope to unravel the semantics of literary place and space in different languages and cultures.

## My Objectives
* to develop computational methods for the humanities and especially literary studies
* to work with and for cultural and educational institutions and foster best practices of an inclusive, diverse and multilingual environment
* to share, collaborate, and be of good use to society
